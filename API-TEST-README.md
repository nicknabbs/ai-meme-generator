# OpenAI API Test Scripts

This directory contains test scripts to verify your OpenAI API key and organization ID functionality, specifically for testing the GPT Image 1 model that your meme generator uses.

## Test Scripts Overview

### 1. `quick-test.js` - Fast Basic Test
A simple, quick test that checks:
- API key authentication
- Model access (including GPT Image 1 availability)
- Basic chat completion
- Basic image generation (if GPT Image 1 is available)

**Usage:**
```bash
REACT_APP_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here node quick-test.js
```

### 2. `test-openai-api.js` - Comprehensive Test Suite
A detailed test suite that checks:
- Authentication and configuration
- Multiple standard models (GPT-4, GPT-4 Turbo, GPT-3.5 Turbo)
- GPT Image 1 functionality with detailed debugging
- Generates a detailed JSON report

**Usage:**
```bash
REACT_APP_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here node test-openai-api.js
```

### 3. `run-api-test.sh` - Test Runner Script
A bash script that runs the comprehensive test with environment validation.

**Usage:**
```bash
export REACT_APP_OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key_here"
./run-api-test.sh
```

## Configuration Details

The tests use the following configuration:
- **Organization ID**: `org-2EYm2mphT2Yn21zw5J1DtVJq`
- **API Key**: Set via `REACT_APP_OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable
- **Timeout**: 30 seconds for standard tests, 5 minutes for image generation

## What the Tests Check

### Authentication Issues
- ‚úÖ API key validity
- ‚úÖ Organization access
- ‚úÖ Model availability

### Standard Model Access
- ‚úÖ GPT-4 access
- ‚úÖ GPT-4 Turbo access  
- ‚úÖ GPT-3.5 Turbo access

### GPT Image 1 Specific Tests
- ‚úÖ Model availability in your organization
- ‚úÖ Image generation functionality
- ‚úÖ Response format validation
- ‚úÖ URL extraction from response
- üîç Detailed debugging output for troubleshooting

## Common Issues and Solutions

### 500 Internal Server Error
This usually indicates:
1. **Invalid API Key**: The key is wrong or expired
2. **Organization Access**: Your organization doesn't have access to the requested model
3. **Billing Issues**: Account has insufficient credits or billing problems
4. **Rate Limiting**: Too many requests in a short time

### GPT Image 1 Not Available
If GPT Image 1 is not available:
1. Check if your organization has been granted access to the model
2. Verify billing is set up correctly
3. Contact OpenAI support about GPT Image 1 access

### Timeout Errors
Image generation can take several minutes:
- The tests use appropriate timeouts (5 minutes for images)
- Your Netlify function should also have adequate timeout settings

## Output Files

The comprehensive test generates:
- `openai-api-test-report.json` - Detailed JSON report with all test results

## Troubleshooting 500 Errors in Your Meme Generator

Based on the test results, you can identify:

1. **Authentication Problems**: If basic auth fails, fix your API key
2. **Model Access Issues**: If GPT Image 1 isn't available, contact OpenAI or use a different model
3. **Response Format Issues**: The tests show exactly how GPT Image 1 responses are structured
4. **Timeout Problems**: Adjust your Netlify function timeout settings
